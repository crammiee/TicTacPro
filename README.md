# Tacfinity

A customizable Tic Tac Toe game with a smart AI opponent. Play on any grid size up to 20×20, set your own win condition, and challenge an AI that scales from easy to unbeatable.

## Features

- **Custom board sizes** — any grid from 3×3 up to 20×20
- **Custom win condition** — set how many in a row to win
- **2 Player mode** — local hotseat
- **vs AI mode** — three difficulty levels
  - Easy — mostly random with occasional smart moves
  - Medium — depth-3 minimax search
  - Hard — adaptive minimax (perfect play on small boards, heuristic search on large ones) with fork detection
- **Score tracking** across rounds

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — strict mode, fully typed
- **Vite** — dev server and build tool
- **Vanilla DOM** — no framework, component-based architecture
- **ESLint + Prettier** — enforced code style
